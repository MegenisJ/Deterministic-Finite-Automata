The code in this document is named according to the tasks they complete. However, many of the programs use each other to execute. 
Commands I entered when testing code. 
python3 Task1.py D1.txt

python3 Task2.py D1.txt D2.txt

python3 Task3.py D1.txt D2.txt 

python3 Task4.py D2.txt 

python3 Task5.py D1.txt D2.txt

dfa.py is not used as an answer to any question. Its a class used to represent the DFA encoding within the program.


Task 4 is not complete and does not produce an example string accepted by the DFA. However is does determmine if the DFA is non empty.
